# Assignment_4

## Project description
Assignment (4) is a Design System with Interactive Components that focuses on building a functional design system with reusable UI components. The system showcases at least 8 interactive components, each demonstrating different states (default, hover, active, disabled, etc.). The goal of this project is to create a versatile and modular design system that can be easily integrated into any web application


## Project Installation 
To install the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ceciliamanner/assignment_4
Navigate into into the project directory:

cd assignment_4 
Open the index.html file in your preffered web browser to get started.

No dependencies or build tools are required for this project, as it is simple front-end application. 


## Usage
To use assignment_4:
Open the index.html file in a browser. 

The design system showcases multiple interactive UI components such as Buttons, Cards, Toggles, Dropdowns, Navigation Bars, Alerts, Tooltips, and Toasts. These components are organized in a simple tabbed interface:

At the top of the page, you'll find a row of buttons representing each component type (e.g., Buttons, Card, Toggle).
Clicking on any component name will display that specific component, showing its various states and interactivity (such as default, hover, and active states).
The accordion-style navigation allows you to easily switch between the components, providing a clean and organized way to explore them.


## Features 
Interactive UI Components
The design system includes eight interactive components: Buttons, Cards, Toggles, Dropdowns, Navigation Bars, Alerts, Tooltips, and Toasts. Each component is displayed in various states, such as default, hover, active, and disabled, providing users with a clear view of how each behaves in different scenarios.

Tabbed Navigation Interface
Components are organized in a clean, tabbed interface, allowing users to easily switch between different sections. By clicking on the component names, users can explore its different states and interact with each component, such as hovering over buttons, toggling switches, or activating cards.
